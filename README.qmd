# gdocker

`gdocker` is a command-line tool written in Go for managing and building Docker images.
It provides commands to show image dependencies, build images with dependency resolution,
run containers with preset options, and manage image directories.

## Install

Before installing `gdocker`, ensure the following are installed on your system:

- Go
- make
- docker

To install `gdocker`, run the following command in terminal:

```{bash}
#| eval: false
GOPROXY=direct go install -trimpath -ldflags='-s -w' github.com/t-arae/gdocker@latest
```

If the `$GOPATH/bin` is not in the `$PATH`, add it.

```{bash}
#| eval: false
# Add this line to your ~/.profile
# Before adding, check your GOPATH by `go env` and replace below with it.
export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
```

## main commmand 

To see the available commands and global options, run:

```{bash}
gdocker --help
```

This will display a list of all supported subcommands and their descriptions.
For help with a specific subcommand, use:

```{bash}
#| eval: false
gdocker help <subcommand>
```

Replace <subcommand> with the name of the command you want help with (e.g., build, showdeps, run).
